## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The data set we will be exploring is relating to academic performance in students grade 1-12. As students ourselves, we are interested in exploring how different factors may predict class participation. For example, how does gender and grade level effect number of times a student raises their hand, participates in a group discussion, or is absent. This information could also be useful for teachers. If there are drastic differences between genders or grades, they can alter their behaviour or perhaps create situations that encourage the lagging group to increase participation within the classroom. It is well established that increased participation in the classroom results in greater academic success (Yamarik, 2007)

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was collected in 2016 using a "learner activity tracking" tool (xADI)from a learning management system (LMS). It was collected over the course of two academic semesters - 245 students were recorded in the first semester, 235 in the second. Data was collected for 480 students on 16 unique variables. These variables include demographic information, academic placement, and classroom behaviour. 305 of the students identified as male; 175 as female. The variables that we are interested in for this analysis are: gender, educational stage, grade level, number of times a student raised their hand, number of times they participated in a discussion group, number of days absent, and class grade (low, middle, or high performing). We plan to look at correlations beteen these variables and compare averages between different groups of students. It has been well established empirically that participation in class can affect academic outcomes. Thus, we hope this data set supports these findings.
